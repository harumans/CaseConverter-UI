# CaseConverter-UI
Case converter Ui application made in flutter framework
---
To try the app you can clone the project and go to installers and install it or just install it from Releases.
---
I made this application to edit my text form, the application have three main functions:


*UpperCase* : Makes your text UPPERCASE.

*LowerCase* : Makes your text lowercase.

*Capitalize* : Capitalizes your text.

---
In case you want to edit the source code make a flutter project and replace your *lib* folder with the project's *lib*.


---
In the future i will make the ui batter and probably add more functions. I hope u like it.
